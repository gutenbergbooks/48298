  THE VIRGINIA RAIL.<br />
  <span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Rallus virginianus.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS miniature of <i>Rallus elegans</i>
or king rail, is found throughout
the whole of temperate
North America as far as the
British Provinces, south to Guatemala
and Cuba, and winters almost to the
northern limit of its range. A specimen
was sent by Major Bendire to the
National Museum from Walla Walla,
Wash., which was taken Jan. 16, 1879,
when the snow was more than a foot
deep. Other names of the species are:
Lesser clapper rail, little red rail, and
fresh-water mud hen. The male and
female are like small king rails, are
streaked with dark-brown and yellowish
olive above, have reddish chestnut
wing coverts, are plain brown on top
of head and back of neck, have a white
eyebrow, white throat, breast and sides
bright rufous; the flanks, wing linings
and under tail coverts are broadly
barred with dark brown and white;
eyes red.</p>

<p>The name of this rail is not as appropriate
to-day as it was when Virginia
included nearly all of the territory east
of the Mississippi. It is not a local
bird, but nests from New York, Ohio,
and Illinois northward. Short of wing,
with a feeble, fluttering flight when
flushed from the marsh, into which it
quickly drops again, as if incapable of
going farther, it is said this small bird
can nevertheless migrate immense distances.
One small straggler from a
flock going southward, according to
Neltje Blanchan, fell exhausted on the
deck of a vessel off the Long Island
coast nearly a hundred miles at sea.</p>

<p>The rail frequents marshes and boggy
swamps. The nest is built in a tuft of
weeds or grasses close to the water, is
compact and slightly hollowed. The
eggs are cream or buff, sparsely spotted
with reddish-brown and obscure lilac,
from 1.20 to 1.28 inches long to .90 to
.93 broad. The number in a set varies
from six to twelve. The eggs are
hatched in June.</p>

<p>The Virginia rail is almost exclusively
a fresh-water bird. It is not
averse to salt water, but even near the
sea it is likely to find out those spots
in the bay where fresh-water springs
bubble up rather than the brackish.
These springs particularly abound in
Hempstead and Great South Bay on
the south coast of Long Island. Brewster
says the voice of the Virginia rail,
when heard at a distance of only a few
yards, has a vibrating, almost unearthly
quality, and seems to issue from the
ground directly beneath the feet. The
female, when anxious about her eggs
or young, calls <i>ki ki-ki</i> in low tones
and <i>kiu</i>, much like a flicker. The young
of both sexes in autumn give, when
startled, a short, explosive <i>kep</i> or <i>kik</i>,
closely similar to that of the Carolina
rail.</p>

<p>There is said to be more of individual
variation in this species than in
any of the larger, scarcely two examples
being closely alike. The chin and
throat may be distinctly white, or the
cinnamon may extend forward entirely
to the bill. This species is found in
almost any place where it can find suitable
food. Nelson says: "I have often
flushed it in thickets when looking for
woodcock, as well as from the midst
of large marshes. It arrives the first
of May and departs in October; nests
along the borders of prairie sloughs
and marshes, depositing from eight to
fourteen eggs. The nest may often be
discovered at a distance by the appearance
of the surrounding grass, the
blades of which are in many cases interwoven
over the nest, apparently to
shield the bird from the fierce rays of
the sun, which are felt with redoubled
force on the marshes. The nests are
sometimes built on a solitary tussock
of grass, growing in the water, but not
often. The usual position is in the
soft, dense grass growing close to the
edge of the slough, and rarely in grass
over eight inches high. The nest is
a thick, matted platform of marsh
grasses, with a medium-sized depression
for the eggs."</p>

<p>Some of the rails have such poor
wings that it has been believed by some
unthinking people that they turn to
frogs in the fall instead of migrating&mdash;a
theory parallel with that which formerly
held that swallows hibernate in
the mud of shallow ponds.</p>

<h2><a name="COTTON_FABRICS" id="COTTON_FABRICS"></a>COTTON FABRICS.</h2>

<p class="ac">W. E. WATT, A.M.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is a remarkable thing in the history
of the United States that,
when the iron shackles were about
to fall from the bondman, he was
caught by a cotton fiber and held for
nearly a century longer. We were
about to emancipate the slaves a century
ago when Eli Whitney invented
the cotton gin, multiplied cotton production
by two hundred, and made
slavery profitable throughout the
South. The South Carolina legislature
gave Whitney $50,000 and cotton became
king and controlled our commerce
and politics.</p>

<p>Eight bags of cotton went out of
Charleston for Liverpool in 1784.
Now about six million bales go annually,
and we keep three million bales
for our own use. So two-thirds of our
cotton goes to England. The cotton
we ship sells for more than all our
flour. Cotton is still king.</p>

<p>In our civil war we came very near
being thrown into conflict with
England by an entanglement of the
same fiber which caught the black man.
One of the greatest industries of
England in 1861-5 was cotton manufacture,
and when we, by our blockade
system, closed the southern ports so
cotton could not be carried out, we
nearly shut down all the works in that
country where cotton was made up.
That meant hard times to many towns
and suffering to many families. That
is why so many Englishmen said we
ought to be satisfied to cut our country
in two and let the people of the Confederacy
have their way.</p>

<p>Cotton is a world-wide product. It
grows in all warm countries everywhere,
sometimes as a tree and sometimes
as a shrub. It is usually spoken
of as a plant. There was cotton grown
in Chicago last year. Not in a hot
house, but in a back yard with very
little attention. A little girl got some
seed, planted it, and had some fine
bolls in the fall. It is a pretty plant,
and was cultivated in China nearly a
thousand years ago as a garden plant.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us that the clothing
worn by the men in Xerxes' army was
made of cotton. Their cotton goods
attracted wide attention wherever they
marched. Columbus found the natives
of the West Indies clothed in cotton.
Cotton goods is not only wide spread,
but very ancient. Cloth was made
from this plant in China twenty-one
hundred years ago. At the coronation
of the emperor, 502 A.D., the robe of
state which he wore was made of cotton,
and all China wondered at the
glory of his apparel.</p>

<p>More capital is used and more labor
employed in the manufacture and distribution
of cotton than of any other
manufactured product. There is one
industry in Chicago which out-ranks
cotton. It is the live-stock business.
More money is spent for meat and
live-stock products than for cotton,
taking the whole country together.
But cotton ranks first as a manufacture.</p>

<p>We spend more for meat than for
cotton goods, and more for cotton
goods than for wheat and flour. The
hog and cotton seed have a peculiar
commercial relation to each other.
The oils produced from them are so
nearly alike that lard makers use cotton
seed oil to cheapen their output.
A large part of what is sold as pure
leaf lard comes from the cotton plant.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago a good spinner
used to make four miles of thread in a
day. This was cut into eight skeins.
Now one man can do the work of a
thousand spinners because of machinery.
One gin does to-day what it took
a thousand workers to do then. Five
men are employed in the running of
one gin, so the gin alone makes one
man equal to two hundred. Because one
workman cleans two hundred times as
much cotton since Whitney's time as
before, cotton-raising has become a
broad industry. The reason more cotton
was not raised in the olden times
is that it could not be used. Now we
can use as much cotton as we can possibly
raise.</p>

<p>At first there was strong opposition
to these improvements in machinery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
because the workmen felt their occupation
would be taken away. But the
cotton workers are to be congratulated,
for there are four times as many men
working in the cotton industries as
there were a hundred years ago, and
yarn thread is produced at less than
one-tenth the cost while the workmen
are all better paid for their labor.</p>

<p>James Hargreaves invented the spinning
jenny in 1767. He was an illiterate
man, and yet his machinery has
not been materially improved upon.
The poor fellow was mobbed by the
infuriated workmen who saw that their
labor was apparently to be taken from
them by machinery. He was nearly
killed. He sold out his invention and
died in poverty. He received nothing
from the government nor from the
business world for his great invention.
But after his death his daughter received
a bounty.</p>

<p>Two years after the jenny, in 1769,
Richard Arkwright invented the spinning
frame. He was a barber by trade,
but through the appreciation of crazy
old George III., he was struck upon
the shoulder with a sword and rose
Sir Richard Arkwright. He amassed
a great fortune from his invention.
His spinning frame and Hargreaves'
spinning jenny each needed the other
to perfect its work. The jenny made
yarn which was not smooth and hard.
So it was used only for woof, and could
not be stretched for warping. The result
of the two inventions was a strong,
even thread which was better for all
purposes than any which had been
made before.</p>

<p>Parliament imposed a fine of $2,500
for sending American cotton cloth to
England, and another for exporting
machinery to America. Massachusetts
at once gave a bonus of $2,500, and
afterwards $10,000 to encourage the introduction
of cotton machinery.
Francis Cabot Lowell was an American
inventor. He brought the business of
weaving cotton cloth to this country.
There had been some small attempts
before his time, but he introduced it
extensively and profitably. He established
a cotton factory in Massachusetts
in 1810, and was very successful.
In that year he was in England, dealing
with makers of cotton goods. The
idea occurred to him that it would be
more profitable to make the goods on
his side of the water where the cotton
was raised. He acted promptly.
Lowell, Massachusetts, is named after
him, and stands as a monument to his
good judgment and inventive genius.</p>

<p>Three years after he had established
the manufacture of cotton goods in
this country, he invented the famous
power loom. That was a great step in
advance. It has done more for the industry
than anything since the days of
Hargreaves and Arkwright. By the
use of power these looms set the spindles
running at a remarkable rate of
speed. Twenty years ago the world
wondered at the velocity of our spindles,
5,000 revolutions in one minute.
But it has kept on wondering ever
since, and the speed of spindles has
constantly increased as if there could
be no limit. 15,000 revolutions are now
common.</p>

<p>In Great Britain there are 45,000,000
spindles running at a wondrous rate,
and 17,000,000 are running in America.
With cheaper labor and more extended
experience, they are doing more of it
across the water than we. For our
consumption we make all the coarse
grades, but all the fine cottons are imported.
They get large quantities of
cotton now in India. Egypt also is a
great cotton country, producing the
best cotton grown with the one exception
of our famous sea island cotton.
Her crop is worth $48,000,000 annually.
England has hunted the world over for
cotton and good cotton ground, and
while we were engaged in war she was
increasing her endeavors in this direction
with much earnestness.</p>

<p>If you will notice the contents of a
boll of cotton you will be surprised to
find that the fiber is not the main thing
there. The seed is far heavier than
the fiber, and it really occupies more
space when the two are crowded into
their closest possible limits. You can
press the cotton down upon the seed
till the whole is but little larger than
the seed.</p>

<p>The fiber clings to the seed with
great firmness, and you find it difficult
to tear them from each other. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
is no wonder it was such a slow process
to separate them in the good old
days. The Yankee, Eli Whitney, went
to Georgia to teach school, but by the
time he arrived there the school was
taken by another, and he was out of
employment. That was a happy misfortune
for him and for the country.</p>

<p>He was a nailer, a cane maker, and a
worker in wood and metal. A Yankee
nailer cannot be idle in a strange land.
The expression, "as busy as a nailer,"
is a good one. Whitney looked about
him to see what was the popular demand
in his line. He found the greatest
difficulty the southern people had
to contend with was the separating of
cotton from its seed. He went at the
business of inventing a machine to do
the work for them.</p>

<p>He placed a saw in a slit in a table
so that cotton could be pushed against
its teeth as it revolved. The teeth
caught into the fiber and pulled it
away from the seeds. As the seeds
were too large to pass through the slit
in the table they flew away as the fiber
let go its hold upon them, and Whitney
soon found he had solved the problem.</p>

<p>This is the first step in what may be
called the manufacture of cotton
fabrics. In another article we shall
examine all the various sorts of textiles
that are made from this interesting
fiber, and speak of their manufacture,
treatment, sale, and use.</p>

<p>Under Whitney's gin the bulky seeds
soon began to pile up astonishingly,
and it became customary to remove
the gins as the piles of this useless
seed accumulated. It was left to rot
upon the ground in these heaps just as
it fell from the gin. Another ingenious
Yankee saw there was a great deal of
material going to waste in these piles,
and he experimented to see what could
be done with the seed.</p>

<p>It was found to be very good for use
on ground that had become poor by exhaustive
farming. An excellent fertilizer
is made from it. The cake is
used for feed for cattle to great advantage.
Dairymen regulate the quality
and color of the milk they get from
their cows by varying the amount of
oil cake given in their food. The oil
extracted from this seed is used in the
arts. It is not equal to linseed oil for
painters' use, but it is a great substance
for use in mixing in with better oils to
make them go farther. In other words,
it is largely used for the purposes of
adulterating other oils. Not only is it
used in making lard, but it is now sold
on its own merits for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>Two days out of New York we
sighted the black smoke of a great
steamer. At sea everybody is on the
lookout for vessels and much interested
in the passengers that may be on
the craft casually met. So we kept
watch of the horizon and were glad to
see that a big one was coming our way.
She was headed so nearly towards us
that we hoped to get a good view of
the many passengers that might be expected
on so large a ship. When she
was near enough to show some of her
side, she looked rusty and ill kept. We
wondered what the fare must be for a
ride across the water on such a cheap-looking
monster. As she came nearer
we saw there were no passengers.
"What is she?" "What does she
carry?" The first mate told us she
was a tank steamer, running between
the United States and Belgium, carrying
4,200 tons of cotton-seed oil at a trip.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GRASSHOPPER_SPIDER" id="THE_GRASSHOPPER_SPIDER"></a>
  THE GRASSHOPPER SPIDER.</h2>

<p class="ac">CHARLES CRISTADORO.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_o.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">OUT in the garden where the western
sun flooded the nasturtiums
along the garden wall, a large
yellow and black-bodied spider
made his lair. The driving rain of the
night before had so torn and disarranged
his web that he had set about
building himself a new one lower down.
Already he had spun and placed the
spokes or bars of his gigantic web and
was now making the circles to complete
his geometric diagram.</p>

<p>From his tail he exuded a white,
sticky substance, which, when stretched,
instantly became dry. As he stepped
from one spoke to another he would
spin out his web and, stretching the
spoke towards the preceding one, bring
the fresh-spun web in contact with it
and then exude upon the jointure an
atom of fresh web, which immediately
cemented the two parts, when the
spoke settled back into place, pulling
the cross web straight and taut.
The process of house-building continued
uninterruptedly, every movement
of the spider producing some result.
No useless steps were taken, and as
the work progressed the uniformity of
the work was simply amazing; every
square, every cross piece, was placed exactly
in the same relative position as
to distance, etc. A micrometer seemingly
would not have shown the deviation
of .000001 of an inch between any
two of the squares.</p>

<p>When the web was three-fourths
finished a lusty grasshopper went blundering
up against one of the yet uncovered
spokes of the web and escaped.
The spider noticed this and visibly increased
his efforts and sped from spoke
to spoke, trailing his never ending film
of silky web behind him. At last the
trap was set and, hastening to the
center, he quickly covered the point
with web after web, until he had a
smooth, solid floor with an opening
that allowed the tenant to occupy
either side of the house at will. The
spot was well selected, the hoppers in
the heat of the day finding the heavy
shade of the broad nasturtium leaves
particularly grateful.</p>

<p>Our friend the spider had not long
to wait for his breakfast, for presto!&mdash;a
great, brown-winged hopper flew right
into the net. Before he could, with
his strong wings and powerful legs,
tear the silken gossamer asunder and
free himself, like lightning our spider
was upon him. In the flash of an eye
the grasshopper was actually enshrouded
in a sheet of white film of
web, and with the utmost rapidity was
rolled over and over by the spider,
which used its long legs with the utmost
dexterity. Wound in his graveyard
suit of white silk, the grasshopper became
absolutely helpless. His broad
wings and sinewy legs were now useless.
The spider retreated to the
center of the web and watched the
throes of his prey. By much effort
the hopper loosed one leg and was
bidding fair to kick the net to shreds
when the spider made another sally
and, putting a fresh coating of sticky
web around him, rolled him over once
or twice more and left him.</p>

<p>In a few moments, when all was over,
the spider attacked his prey and began
his breakfast. Before his meal was
well under way, a second hopper flew
into the parlor of the spider and, leaving
his meal, the agile creature soon
had hopper number two securely and
safely ensnared. No experienced football
tackle ever downed his opponent
with any such skill or celerity as the
spider displayed as he rolled over and
bundled up into a helpless web-covered
roll the foolish and careless hopper.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"The spiders touch, how exquisitely fine!</div>
      <div class="verse">Feels at each thread, and lives along the line."</div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SO many names have been applied
to this duck that much confusion
exists in the minds of
many as to which to distinguish
it by. A few of them are blue-winged;
white-face, or white-faced teal; summer
teal, and <i>cerceta comun</i> (Mexico.)
It inhabits North America in general,
but chiefly the eastern provinces; north
to Alaska, south in winter throughout
West Indies, Central America, and
northern South America as far as Ecuador.
It is accidental in Europe.</p>

<p>The blue-winged teal is stated to be
probably the most numerous of our
smaller ducks, and, though by far the
larger number occur only during the
migrations, individuals may be found
at all times of the year under favorable
circumstances of locality and weather.
The bulk of the species, says Ridgway,
winters in the Gulf states and southward,
while the breeding-range is difficult
to make out, owing to the fact that
it is not gregarious during the nesting-season,
but occurs scatteringly in isolated
localities where it is most likely
to escape observation.</p>

<p>The flight of this duck, according to
"Water Birds of North America," is
fully as swift as that of the passenger
pigeon. "When advancing against a
stiff breeze it shows alternately its upper
and lower surface. During its
flight it utters a soft, lisping note,
which it also emits when apprehensive
of danger. It swims buoyantly, and
when in a flock so closely together that
the individuals nearly touch each other.
In consequence of this habit hunters
are able to make a frightful havoc
among these birds on their first appearance
in the fall, when they are
easily approached. Audubon saw as
many as eighty-four killed by a single
discharge of a double-barreled
gun.</p>

<p>"It may readily be kept in confinement,
soon becomes very docile, feeds
readily on coarse corn meal, and might
easily be domesticated. Prof. Kumlein,
however, has made several unsuccessful
attempts to raise this duck by
placing its eggs under a domestic hen.
He informs me that this species is the
latest duck to arrive in the spring." It
nests on the ground among the reeds
and coarse herbage, generally near the
water, but its nest has been met with at
least half a mile from the nearest water,
though always on low land. The nest
is merely an accumulation of reeds and
rushes lined in the middle with down
and feathers. This duck prefers the
dryer marshes near streams. The nests
are generally well lined with down, and
when the female leaves the nest she
always covers her eggs with down, and
draws the grass, of which the outside
of the nest is composed, over the top.
Prof. Kumlein does not think that she
ever lays more than twelve eggs. These
are of a clear ivory white. They range
from 1.80 to 1.95 inches in length and
1.25 to 1.35 in breadth.</p>

<p>The male whistles and the female
"quacks."</p>

<p>The food of the blue-wing is chiefly
vegetable matter, and its flesh is tender
and excellent. It may be known by
its small size, blue wings, and narrow
bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Mather, for many years
superintendent of the State Fish Hatchery
of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island,
domesticated the mallard and
black duck, bred wood ducks, green
and blue-winged teal, pin-tails, and
other wild fowl. He made a distinction
between breeding and domestication.
He does not believe that blue-winged
teal can be domesticated as the
mallard and black duck can, <i>i. e.</i>, to be
allowed their liberty to go and come
like domestic ducks.</p>

<p>The hind toe of this family of ducks
is without a flap or lobe, and the front
of the foot is furnished with transverse
scales, which are the two features of
these birds which have led scientists to
separate them into a distinct sub-family.
They do not dive for their food,
but nibble at the aquatic plants they
live among; or, with head immersed
and tail in air, "probe the bottom of
shallow waters for small mollusks, crustaceans,
and roots of plants." The
bill acts as a sieve.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GRAY_STUMP" id="THE_GRAY_STUMP"></a>THE GRAY STUMP.</h2>

<p class="ac">NELL KIMBERLY MC ELHONE.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I BEG your pardon, my dear," said
Mr. Flicker, "but you are quite
mistaken. That is <i>not</i> a tree
stump."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Mrs. Flicker
gently, "but I still believe it is."</p>

<p>Now if they had been the sparrows,
or the robins, or the red-winged
blackbirds, they would have gone on
chattering and contradicting until they
came to using claws and bills, and
many feathers would have been shed;
but they were the quiet, well-bred
Flickers, and so they stopped just
here, and once more critically regarded
the object in question.</p>

<p>"Whoever heard of a stump, old and
gray and moss-covered, appearing in
one night?" said Mr. Flicker, after a
pause. "I have seen more of the world
than you have, my dear, and I do assure
you it would take centuries to
make a stump like that." Let it be
here recorded that in this Mr. Flicker
was perfectly correct.</p>

<p>"Well, then," reasoned Mrs. Flicker,
"if it is not a stump, <i>what is it</i>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Flicker looked very wise. He
turned his head first to one side and
then the other&mdash;flashing his beautiful
scarlet crescent in the sunlight. Then
he sidled nearer to his wife and darting
his head down to her, whispered, "It
is a <i>person</i>."</p>

<p>The timid Mrs. Flicker drew back
into the nest in horror, and it was some
moments before she felt like putting
her head out of the door again. In
the meantime she had quieted down
to the thoughtful little flicker she
really was, and had gathered together
her reasoning powers. So out came
the pretty fawn-colored head and
again the argument began.</p>

<p>Though still quivering a little from
the fright, Mrs. Flicker said, in the
firm tones of conviction, "No, Mr.
Flicker, <i>that</i> is not a person. Persons
move about with awkward motions.
Persons make terrible sounds with
their bills. Persons have straight, ugly
wings without feathers&mdash;not made to
fly with, but just to carry burdens
instead of carrying them in their bills.
Persons wear colors that nature disapproves.
Persons point things at us
that make a horrible sound and sometimes
kill. <i>Persons cannot keep still.</i>
That is not a person."</p>

<p>Mr. Flicker was greatly impressed,
and stood like a statue, gazing at what
his wife called a gray stump. She
went back to ponder the matter over
her eggs.</p>

<p>The sprightly little warblers and
goldfinches flashed in and out through
the bushes that grew thickly together
on a small island opposite Mr. Flicker's
nest; the orioles called to one another
in the orchard back of him; the catbirds
performed their ever-varying
tricks in the cherry tree near by; Mr.
Water Wagtail came and splashed
about on the shore of the creek, and
Mr. Kingfisher perched on a stump in
the water, watching for a dainty morsel,
and still Mr. Flicker sat regarding
his new puzzle. He paid no attention
to any of his neighbors&mdash;but for that
matter he seldom did, for the flickers
are aristocratic bird-folk, and mingle
very little with their kind. But on
this day he was particularly oblivious,
so greatly occupied was he with the
gray stump.</p>

<p>Once or twice he had detected a
slight motion on the part of the stump;
a rustle, a change of position, a faint
sign of life&mdash;just enough to make his
little bird-heart thump, but not enough
to warrant flight in so discreet a bird.
But at last there began a quiet bending,
bending of the stump; it was very
slow, but none the less certain, and
Mr. Flicker waited with throbbing
heart, till he saw two large, round,
glassy eyes pointed full at him, then,
with a quick note of warning for his
little wife, he rose in the air with a
whirr, and the golden wings shimmered
away in the sunlight overhead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flicker peeped cautiously forth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and, with her unerring bird instinct,
sought first of all the gray stump
which, alas, was not quite a stump
after all, and was indeed the cause of
the danger. She saw the terrible instrument
still pointed at her husband,
and her heart fluttered wildly; but
there was no report, and she watched
him till she could only see the occasional
flash of the gold-lined wings
and the white spot on his back; and
then behold, the stump was once more
a stump, and Mrs. Flicker returned to
her eggs.</p>

<p>When Mr. Flicker came back, he
flew past his house without once swerving,
and disappeared in a pine tree on
the edge of the orchard, and a conclave
of cedar waxwings in the next
tree discussed his tactics enthusiastically.
The cedar waxwings were also
interested in the gray stump&mdash;but afraid
of it? Oh no, not they! Care sits
lightly on the cedar waxwing's topknot,
and he never takes his dangers
seriously.</p>

<p>A series of deceiving and circuitous
flights finally landed Mr. Flicker at
his own door, and he perched himself
in his hiding-place of leaves and
watched the gray stump with an air of
settled gloom.</p>

<p>However, a bird is a bird, even
though it be a serious flicker, and before
many minutes he and his wife
were chatting happily again. Mrs.
Flicker even asserted boldly that if
<i>she</i> had not her eggs to look after, she
would certainly investigate this thing;
and then Mr. Flicker began to preen
his feathers as if in preparation for the
undertaking, but really to gain time
and get up his courage, when, "Take
care! Take care!" came notes of warning
from the catbirds; and the stump
suddenly lengthened itself like a telescope
and walked away, with its two-eyed
instrument under its arm. Mr.
and Mrs. Flicker watched it gather a
spray of late apple blossoms, saw it
climb the fence and disappear down
the road.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said polite
little Mrs. Flicker to her husband. "I
was wrong; it is not a stump. But,"
she added coaxingly, "it really is more
like a stump than a person, now isn't it?
And I should not be afraid of it again."</p>

<p>When Miss Melissa Moore, school
teacher, returned to Manhattan after
her summer vacation, she confided to
a fellow-teacher that she had made
seventy new acquaintances, and that
she loved them all. Now Miss Melissa
Moore, in her wildest dreams, never
thought of herself as being beautiful,
being a plain, honest person; she even
knew that her bird-hunting costume&mdash;the
short gray skirt and gray flannel
shirt-waist and gray felt hat, whose
brim hung disconsolately over her
glasses, with no color at all to brighten
her&mdash;was <i>not</i> becoming, but if she had
dreamed that Mrs. Flicker had called
her an old gray moss-covered stump,
she would, being only human, have cut
her once and forever, and her list of
new acquaintances would have numbered
sixty-nine.</p>

  THE YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD.<br />
  <span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE geographical distribution of
this member of the blackbird
family is western North
America to the Pacific Ocean,
east to Wisconsin, Illinois, Kansas, and
Texas. The bird is accidental in the
Atlantic states. It is found generally
distributed on the prairies in all favorable
localities from Texas to Illinois.
It is a common bird in the West, collecting
in colonies to breed in marshy
places anywhere in its general range,
often in company with the red-winged
blackbird. The nests are usually
placed in the midst of large marshes,
attached to the tall flags and grasses.
Davie says they are generally large,
light, but thick-brimmed, made of interwoven
grasses and sedges impacted
together. The eggs are from two to
six in number, but the usual number is
four. Their ground color is dull
grayish-white, in some grayish-green,
profusely covered with small blotches
and specks of drab, purplish-brown
and umber. The average size is
1.12 × .75.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson says that the yellow-headed
blackbird is a very common
resident of Cook County, Ill., in large
marshes. It arrives the first of May
and commences nesting the last of that
month. Owing to the restricted localities
inhabited by it, it is but slightly
known among farmers; even those living
near the marshes think it an uncommon
bird. The only difference in
the habits of the male and female is
the slightly greater shyness of the
former. Colonies nest in rushes in the
Calumet marshes, are bold and interesting,
and adults are sometimes seen
on the ground along country roads
some distance from water.</p>

<p>The food of these birds during the
nesting season is worms and grubs,
which are fed each day to the young
birds by the hundreds. In this way
they help protect the crops of the
farmer. In the autumn, when the
young can fly as well as their parents,
they collect in large flocks and start
on their southern journey. At this
time young and old travel together.
Many of them are killed by hawks,
which often follow a flock for days,
dashing into their midst whenever
they see a chance to capture one.</p>

<p>The blackbirds are alike in general
characteristics. They all walk and get
most of their food on the ground. In
spring, when large flocks are roaming
in all directions, one may easily be
confused by them. Miss Merriam says
that with a little care they will easily
be distinguished. The crow blackbirds
may be known by their large size and
long tails. The male cowbird may be
told at a glance, she says, by his
chocolate-colored head, the red-wing
by his epaulettes, and, we may add, the
yellow-headed by the brilliant yellow
of his whole head and neck, "as if he
had plunged up to his shoulders in a
keg of yellow paint, while the rest of
his attire is shining black." He utters
a loud, shrill whistle, quite unlike any
sound produced by his kinsmen.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_YELLOW-HEADED_BLACKBIRD-2" id="THE_YELLOW-HEADED_BLACKBIRD-2"></a>
  THE YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD.</h2>

<p class="ac">E. K. M.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE little readers of <i>Birds and All
Nature</i> will not have much respect
for me, I am afraid, after
reading what Mr. Wood Thrush
said of my family in the last number
of the magazine.</p>

<p>Probably you don't recollect it.
Well, he said that my cousin, Mr. Red-Wing
Blackbird, was often found in
the company of Mr. Cowbird, and that
Mr. Cowbird was a very disreputable
creature, being no better than an outcast
and a tramp.</p>

<p>Humph! Just as though birds, like
boys and girls, are to be judged by the
company they keep. Why, <i>I</i> associate
with Mr. Cowbird, too; he is a distant
relative of mine, and certainly nobody
who looks at my picture can call me
disreputable. See what a glossy black
coat I wear and what a fine yellow collar
and hat. We are only free in our
manners, that is all, helping ourselves
liberally to the grain planted by our
dear friend, Mr. Farmer.</p>

<p>I am not lazy, either, like my relative,
Mr. Cowbird, for I build a new
house every spring, locating it among
the tall flags and grasses in a nice
damp piece of marshland.</p>

<p>Though I am a blackbird, I'm not
found from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
as Mr. Red-Wing is and others of our
tribe. For that reason you can't call
me common, you know. But, then,
our manners and customs are about
the same. We do not hop like other
birds, but walk very much as you do,
putting one foot before the other, a
bit awkwardly, perhaps, but I am sure
with considerable dignity. Indeed, my
mate says but for cocking my head on
one side when strutting on the ground
one might take me for a bishop&mdash;in
feathers&mdash;I have such a solemn, serious
air, as though burdened with a sense
of my own importance.</p>

<p>Like the generality of birds, I find a
warm climate in winter conducive to
my health, so in November I leave the
north and hie me to the south, returning
about the first of May, not so early
as my cousin, Mr. Red-Wing, and the
other common members of the blackbird
family. They, like some visitors,
welcome or unwelcome, usually come
early and stay late.</p>

<p>It strikes me, for that reason, the
blackbird family should be considered
of some importance, even if they do
associate with Mr. Cowbird, tramp that
he is, for when the first flocks of blackbirds
are seen sailing overhead, like
leaves blown by the wind against the
sky, you know that spring is near, no
matter how cold or chill the weather
may be. Crowds and crowds of us are
then seen circling and wheeling above
our last year's nesting-place, talking
and laughing like little children and
making just as much noise.</p>

<p><i>Con-cur-ee</i> is the only song we know,
but we utter that in different tones,
so that our mates consider it very
pleasing, and so may you.</p>

<h2><a name="WITH_OPEN_EYES" id="WITH_OPEN_EYES"></a>WITH OPEN EYES.</h2>

<p class="ac">OLIVE SCHREINER.</p>

<p>... And now we turn to
nature. All these years we have lived
beside her, and we have never seen her;
now we open our eyes and look at her.</p>

<p>The rocks have been to us a blur of
brown; we bend over them, and the
disorganized masses dissolve into a
many-colored, many-shaped, carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
arranged form of existence. Here
masses of rainbow-tinted crystals,
half-fused together; there bands of
smooth gray methodically overlying
each other. This rock here is covered
with a delicate silvery tracery
in some mineral, resembling leaves and
branches; there on the flat stone, on
which we so often have sat to weep and
pray, we look down, and see it covered
with the fossil footprints of great birds,
and the beautiful skeleton of a fish.
We have often tried to picture in our
mind what the fossilized remains of
creatures must be like, and all the while
we sat on them. We have been so
blinded by thinking and feeling that we
have never seen the world.</p>

<p>The flat plain has been to us a reach
of monotonous red. We look at it, and
every handful of sand starts into life.
That wonderful people, the ants, we
learn to know; see them make war and
peace, play and work, and build their
huge palaces. And that smaller people
we make acquaintance with, who live in
the flowers. The citto flower had been
for us a mere blur of yellow; we find
its heart composed of a hundred perfect
flowers, the homes of the tiny black
people with red stripes, who moved in
and out in that little yellow city. Every
bluebell has its inhabitant. Every
day the karroo (plain) shows up a new
wonder sleeping in its teeming bosom.
On our way we pause and stand to see
the ground-spider make its trap, bury
itself in the sand, and then wait for the
falling in of its enemy. Farther on
walks a horned beetle, and near him
starts open the door of a spider, who
peeps out carefully, and quickly puts it
down again. On a karroo-bush a green
fly is laying her silver eggs. We carry
them home, and see the shells pierced,
the spotted grub come out, turn to a
green fly, and flit away. We are not
satisfied with what nature shows us, and
will see something for ourselves. Under
the white hen we put a dozen eggs,
and break one daily to see the white
spot wax into the chicken. We are not
excited or enthusiastic about it; but a
man is not to lay his throat open, he
must think of something. So we plant
seeds in rows on our dam-wall, and pull
one up daily to see how it goes with
them. Alladeen buried her wonderful
stone, and a golden palace sprang up
at her feet. We do far more. We put
a brown seed in the earth, and a living
thing starts out, starts upward&mdash;why,
no more than Alladeen can we say&mdash;starts
upward, and does not desist till
it is higher than our heads, sparkling
with dew in the early morning, glittering
with yellow blossoms, shaking
brown seeds with little embryo souls on
to the ground. We look at it solemnly,
from the time it consists of two leaves
peeping above the ground and a soft
white root, till we have to raise our
faces to look at it; but we find no reason
for that upward starting.</p>

<p>A fowl drowns itself in our dam. We
take it out, and open it on the bank,
and kneel, looking at it. Above are
the organs divided by delicate tissues;
below are the intestines artistically
curved in a spiral form, and each tier
covered by a delicate network of blood-vessels
standing out red against the
faint blue background. Each branch
of the blood-vessels is comprised of a
trunk, bifurcating into the most delicate
hair-like threads, symmetrically
arranged.... Of that same exact
shape and outline is our thorn-tree
seen against the sky in mid-winter; of
that shape also is delicate metallic
tracery between our rocks; in that exact
path does our water flow when without
a furrow we lead it from the dam; so
shaped are the antlers of the horned
beetle. How are these things related
that such deep union should exist
between them all? Is it chance? Or,
are they not all the fine branches of one
trunk, whose sap flows through us all?</p>

<p>... And so it comes to pass,
in time, that the earth ceases for us to
be a weltering chaos. We walk in the
great hall of life, looking up and around
reverentially. Nothing is despicable&mdash;all
is meaning&mdash;full; nothing is small&mdash;all
is part of a whole, whose beginning
and end we know not. The life that
throbs in us is a pulsation from it; too
mighty for our comprehension, not too
small.&mdash;<i>Story of an African Farm.</i></p>

<h2><a name="BIRD_NOTES" id="BIRD_NOTES"></a>BIRD NOTES.</h2>

<p class="ac">ANNE WAKELY JACKSON.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">DURING the late autumn days,
when the summer chorus has
dispersed, and only a few winter
soloists remain to cheer us,
one is more than ever impressed by
the wonderful carrying power of bird
notes. Many of these notes are not at
all loud; and yet we hear them very
distinctly at a comparatively long distance
from their source.</p>

<p>The ear that is trained to listen will
distinguish a bird's note above a great
variety of loud and distracting noises.
This is due, not to the loudness of the
note, but to the quality of its tone.</p>

<p>We all know by experience, though
few of us, alas, profit by it that when
we wish to make ourselves heard, it is
not always necessary to raise our
voices, but only to use a different
quality of tone.</p>

<p>Thus, some singers, when you hear
them in a small room, seem to completely
fill it with sound, while if they
sing in a large hall, they can scarcely
be heard at all beyond a certain distance.
Their voices lack carrying
power, and their notes apparently
escape almost directly after leaving
their mouths.</p>

<p>It is this carrying quality, which can
be cultivated to a large extent in the
human voice, that we find in bird notes.
They produce their notes in a perfectly
natural way. They do not, like us,
have to be trained and taught to sing
naturally.</p>

<p>I believe that nearly every human
voice has some sweet or agreeable
quality in it. If the owner would but
use that part, instead of inflicting the
harsh or strident or shrill part upon
the unfortunate listener, what a musical
world we should live in! No discordant
voices! Think of it!</p>

<p>To go back to the birds. Here is an
example of the penetrating quality of
tone they possess. One morning I
was busily engaged in the back part of
the house, when my ear caught the
sound of a bird's note, and I determined
to follow it up.</p>

<p>It led me to the front part of the
house, out of the front door, down the
walk, across the street, and into a
neighbor's yard where I found my
"caller," a white-breasted nut-hatch,
carefully searching the bark of a tall
soft maple. His note did not sound
particularly loud when I stood there
near him. Yet I had heard it with perfect
distinctness in the rear of the house.</p>

<p>What a penetrating quality there is
in the high, faint "skreeking" of the
brown creeper, and in the metallic
"pip" of the hairy woodpecker.</p>

<p>The birds could teach us many a
lesson on "voice production," if we
would but listen to them.</p>

<p>The person who has never learned to
listen, misses much of the beauty of
life. For him "that hath ears to hear,"
when he goes abroad, the air is full of
subtle music. Not merely the music
of the birds, but other voices of nature
as well; the wind in the trees, the
rustle of leaves.</p>

<p>The unthinking person walks along
the street, seeing nothing, hearing
nothing. What does he miss? Many
things. He misses yon tall tree, which
suggests such strength, such enduring
majesty. He misses the beautiful leaf
that lies in his path, a marvel of exquisitely
blended coloring. He misses
the delicate tracery of slender twigs
and branches, with their background
of blue sky or gray cloud. He misses
the voices of his feathered friends who
would gladly cheer him on his way.
If he thinks of nature at all, he is apt
to think her beauties have departed
with the summer. Not so. If you
love nature, she will never withhold
some part of her beauty from you, no
matter how cold or windy or rainy the
day may be. If you see no beauty it
is not because it is entirely lacking,
but because you are blind to it.</p>

<p>The love of nature is a great gift, a
gift that is within the reach of all of
us. Let us, then, cultivate this gift,
and we shall find beauty and harmony
and peace, such as we never dreamed
of before. Our lives will become
better and nobler for the contact with
nature, and we shall be brought into a
closer understanding of nature's God.</p>

<h2><a name="SOUTHWARD_BOUND" id="SOUTHWARD_BOUND"></a>SOUTHWARD BOUND.</h2>

<p class="ac">A FALL EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p class="ac">ELLA F. MOSBY.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT was October 8, and many birds
had gone on their long journey to
tropical lands. The fog hung thick
like a white blanket between the
trees, and obscured all distant objects,
such as mountain ranges or winding
rivers, from view. My home was
in Lynchburg, on the James River, and
consequently in the line of the "birds'
highway," and I was standing beside
the window on the lookout for migrants,
when, to my surprise, there alighted in the
tree beside me a female scarlet tanager
in olive-green and dusky yellow, with
her soft, innocent eyes looking with
gentle confidence around her. In a
few minutes the trees around her were
ringing with <i>chip cheer! chip cheer!</i>
from a large flock of tanagers that had
evidently lost their way in the fog, and
descended near the ground to make observations.
During the morning three
different <i>waves</i> of migrating tanagers
passed, flying slowly and so low that it
was easy to see and recognize them.</p>

<p>The next day it was again thickly
foggy. As I glanced out at the window I
saw another tanager, sitting motionless
on a bough. From ten to three wave
after wave, in even greater numbers
than the day before, passed. Frequently
there were from three to nine
tanagers perched in full view, occasionally
calling <i>chip cheer!</i> but usually
quietly resting or eating insects, of
which the trees were full. I heard one
<i>crunching</i> a hard-shelled bit in his
strong beak. The scarlet of summer
was not to be seen in the fall plumage
of green and yellow, but the books are
misleading when they speak of the
male as "dull," or "like the female."
It is true he is green above and yellow
underneath, but where her wings are
darker or "fuscous," his wings and tail
are a glossy, velvety black, and instead
of her dull yellow, his breast is a shining
and vivid lemon-yellow, so that
he is almost as beautiful as in his black
and scarlet. In such large flocks I saw
every phase of varying yellow or green
in the immature males and females, one
of the latter seeming a soft olive all
over, slightly greener above and slightly
more yellow below. Even in the spring,
when our woods ring with the joyous
calls and songs of both varieties, I have
never seen half the number of tanagers
together.</p>

<p>I was interested in noticing how
many of our migrating birds gathered
in unusually large flocks. The oven
birds and the mocking-birds were seen
in large numbers before they left, for
many, if not most of the latter, do go
farther South in cold weather. I heard
one of the mocking-birds singing the
most exquisite song, but softened almost
to a whisper, as if singing in a
dream a farewell to the trees he knew
so well. He sang in this way for quite
a long while, the rest of the flock flying
excitedly to and fro. I also saw a large
flock of chebecs instead of the one or
two scattered migrants I was accustomed
to see in the fall. The gay-colored
sapsuckers came to us in large
flocks&mdash;they spend the winter with us&mdash;filling
the trees around us.</p>

<p>For the first time, too, I had an experience
of the caprices of migrating
warblers. The blackpolls and pine-warblers,
so numerous last year, had
evidently chosen another route to the
tropics, nor were the magnolia and the
chestnut-sided to be seen. But the
Cape May warblers, usually rare, were
very numerous, and remained long&mdash;from
September 20 to October 18. This
might probably be explained by the
abundant supply of food, for the unusual
warmth of the season had not
only awakened the fruit trees and lilacs,
the kalmia and other wild flowers, to a
second period of blooming, but had
filled the air with immense swarms of
tiny insects. Everywhere glittered and
danced myriads of winged creatures,
and the trees offered a plentiful table
for our insect-loving warblers.</p>

<p>The squirrels are found in all parts
of the globe except Australia, where,
however, there is a far worse pest of
the agriculturist, the abundant rabbit.
All the varieties, according to the authorities,
correspond so closely in form,
structure, habits and character that it
is sufficient to describe the common
squirrel and its habits, in order to gain
sufficient knowledge of the whole tribe.
The body of the true squirrel is elongated,
tail long, and its fur evenly parted
lengthwise along the upper surface.
The eyes are large and prominent, the
ears may be either small or large, scantily
covered with hair or are furnished
with tufts. The fore-legs are shorter
than the rear. The fore-paws have four
toes and one thumb, the hind-paws
have five toes.</p>

<p>The time to see the squirrels is in the
early morning when they come to the
ground to feed, and in the woods large
numbers may be seen frisking about on
the branches or chasing up and down
the trunks. If alarmed the squirrel
springs up a tree with extraordinary activity
and hides behind a branch. This
trick often enables it to escape its enemy
the hawk, and by constantly slipping
behind the large branches frequently
tires it out. The daring and
activity of the little animal is remarkable.
When pursued it leaps from
branch to branch, or from tree to tree,
altering its direction while in the air by
means of its tail, which acts as a rudder.</p>

<p>It is easily domesticated and is very
amusing in its habits when suffered to
go at large in a room or kept in a spacious
cage, but when confined in a little
box, especially in one of the cruel wheel
cages, its energies and playfulness are
quite lost. The ancient Greeks were
fully aware of its attractive qualities,
and we are indebted to them for its
scientific name. That name signifies
"he who is under the shadow of his
tail," and everyone who knows the
meaning of the Greek word <i>sciurus</i>
"must involuntarily think of the lively
little creature as it sits on the loftiest
branches of the trees."</p>

<p>The favorite haunts of the squirrel
are dry, shady forests. When fruits
and nuts are ripe it visits the village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gardens. Where there are many pine
cones it makes its permanent home,
building one or more, usually in old
nests of crows which it improves. If
it does not intend to remain long it
uses the nests of magpies, crows, or
birds of prey, but the nest which it intends
to serve as a permanent sleeping-place,
a shelter against bad weather, or
a nursery, is newly built. It is said
that every squirrel has at least four
nests; but nothing has been definitely
proven on this score. Brehm says they
also build in hollow trees; that the open-air
nests usually lie in a fork close to
the main trunk of the tree; the bottom
is built like one of the larger bird nests
while above there is a flat, conical
roof after the manner of magpies' nests,
close enough to be impenetrable to the
rain. The main entrance is placed sideways,
usually facing the east; a slightly
smaller loop-hole for escape from its
many enemies is found close to the
trunk.</p>

<p>According to the season it eats fruit
or seeds, buds, twigs, shells, berries,
grain and mushrooms. The seeds,
buds and young shoots of fir and
pine trees probably form its principal
food.</p>

<p>As soon as the animal is provided with
food in abundance it lays by stores for
later and less plenteous times, carrying
to its storerooms nuts, grains and kernels,
sometimes from a great distance.
In the forests of southeastern Siberia
the squirrels also store away mushrooms,
and that in a very peculiar
manner.</p>

<p>"They are so unselfish," says Radde,
"that they do not think of hiding their
supply of mushrooms, but pin them on
the pine needles or in larch woods on
the small twigs. There they leave the
mushrooms to dry, and in times of
scarcity of food these stores are of good
service to some roaming individual of
their kind."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DOVE_NOAHS_MESSENGER" id="THE_DOVE_NOAHS_MESSENGER"></a>
  THE DOVE. NOAH'S MESSENGER.</h2>

<p class="ac">GRANVILLE OSBORNE.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the beautiful incidents of
scripture none has become more
familiar to old and young alike
than that which relates how
Noah "sent forth a dove from him to
see if the waters were abated from off
the face of the ground." We can imagine
the timid messenger sent forth
by Noah's hand from the open window
of the ark. Over the vast surface of
the waters it flew, in obedience to
natural instincts, seeking a place of
rest, but, as the narrative relates, "the
dove found no rest for the sole of her
foot, and she returned unto him into
the ark, for the waters were on the face
of the whole earth." With what an unerring
flight the dove had returned to
the only safe refuge, and how gently
did Noah "put forth his hand" and
"draw her in unto him," after the
weary quest was over and the tired
wings had only brought back a message
of defeated hopes. After seven
days had gone by Noah sent forth the
dove again with longing expectancy
that the flood might be receding. With
swift flight the dove disappeared from
view, and, high in air, sought amid the
waste of waters, with its marvelous
powers of sight, for any sign which told
of safety and rest. At length it reached
a refuge, the spot it sought, where
the valleys once more began to show
themselves above the depths. And in
the evening, as Noah watched and
waited at the open window of the ark,
he saw afar off the glint of snowy wings
against the golden sky, and "lo, the
dove returned, bearing in her mouth
an olive leaf plucked off, so Noah knew
that the waters were abated from off
the earth." The olive branch was a
token that even the trees in the valleys
were uncovered, and has been the type
in all after ages of peace and rest. The
Hebrew word "yonah" is the general
name for the many varieties of doves
and pigeons found in Bible lands. It
is frequently used by the prophetic
writers as a symbol of comparison.
Both Isaiah and Ezekiel speak of doves
that "fly as a cloud." In many of the
wild valleys of Palestine the cliffs are
full of caves, and there the wild pigeons
build their nests and fly in flocks
that truly are "like the clouds" in
number. Again the same prophets
speak of the "doves of the valleys, all
of them mourning." This is peculiarly
applicable to the turtle dove. Its low,
sad plaint may be heard all day long
at certain seasons in the olive groves
and in the solitary and shady valleys
amongst the mountains. These birds
can never be tamed. Confined in a
cage, they languish and die, but no
sooner are they set at liberty than they
"flee as a bird" to their mountains.
David refers to their habits in this respect
when his heart was sad within
him: "O that I had wings like a dove,
for then would I fly away and be at
rest." Nahum alludes to a striking
habit of the dove when he says: "And
the maids of Hazzab shall lead her as
with the voice of doves, tabering upon
their breasts."</p>

<p>Hazzab was the queen of Nineveh,
who was to be led by her maidens into
captivity, mourning as doves do, and
"tabering," or striking on their breasts,
a common practice in that country.</p>

<p>David, in beautiful imagery, comforts
those who mourn, saying: "Though ye
have lain among the pots, ye shall be
as the wings of a dove covered with
silver and her feathers with yellow
gold." A dove of Damascus is referred
to whose feathers have the metallic
luster of silver and the gleam of gold.
They are small and kept in cages.
Their note is very sad and the cooing
kept up by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>To the millions who devoutly sing of
the "Heavenly Dove" no other symbol
either in or out of the Bible suggests
so much precious instruction and
spiritual comfort as this innocent bird&mdash;pure,
gentle, meek, loving, faithful, the
appropriate emblem of that "Holy
Spirit" that descended from the open
heavens upon our Lord at his baptism.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WEASEL" id="THE_WEASEL"></a>THE WEASEL.<br />
<span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Putorius vulgaris.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS is the smallest beast of prey,
but so agile and courageous
that it is regarded as a model of
carnivorous animals. It dwells
in fields, gardens, burrows, clefts of
rock, under stones or wood piles, and
roams around by day as well as by
night. Its slender and attenuated shape
enables it to enter and explore the habitations
of the smallest animals, and,
as it is a destroyer of rats, mice, and
other noxious animals, it is useful and
deserves protection. It is, however,
hunted by many who do not appreciate
its value.</p>

<p>The weasel attains a length of eight
inches, including the tail. The body
appears to be longer than it really
is because the neck and head are
of about the same circumference as
the body. It is of the same thickness
from head to tail.</p>

<p>This animal is found throughout Europe,
Canada, and the northern portions
of the United States. Plains,
mountains, forests, populous districts,
as well as the wilderness, are its home.
It adapts itself to circumstances, and
can find a suitable dwelling-place in
any locality. It is found in barns, cellars,
garrets, and similar retreats.</p>

<p>An observer says one who noiselessly
approaches the hiding-place of
a weasel may easily secure the pleasure
of watching it. He may then hear
a slight rustle of leaves and see a small,
brown creature gliding along. As soon
as it catches sight of a human being it
stands on its hind legs to obtain a better
view. "The idea of flight seldom
enters this dwarf-like creature's head,
but it looks at the world with a pair of
bold eyes and assumes an attitude of
defiance." Men have been attacked
by it. A naturalist once saw a large
bird swoop down on a field, pick up a
small animal and fly upward with it.
Suddenly the bird staggered in its
flight, and then dropped to the ground
dead. A weasel tripped merrily away.
It had severed its enemy's neck with
its teeth and thus escaped.</p>

<p>The weasel preys upon mice, house
rats and water rats, moles, hares, rabbits,
chickens, birds, lizards, snakes,
frogs, fish, and crabs.</p>

<p>A litter of weasels numbers eight.
The mother is very fond of the little
blind creatures and nourishes them
until long after they can see.</p>

<p>Buffon said this little animal was not
capable of domestication, but as a matter
of fact, when accustomed to people
from childhood, it becomes very tame
and attractive.</p>

<p>A lady tells the following anecdote
of her pet weasel:</p>

<p>"If I pour some milk into my hand
my tame weasel will drink a good deal,
but if I do not pay it this compliment
it will scarcely take a drop. When
satisfied it generally goes to sleep. My
chamber is the place of its residence
and I have found a method of dispelling
its strong odor by perfumes. By
day it sleeps in a quilt, into which it
gets by an unsewn place which it has
discovered on the edge; during the
night it is kept in a wired box or cage,
which it always enters with reluctance
and leaves with pleasure. If it be set
at liberty before my time of rising,
after a thousand playful little tricks, it
gets into my bed and goes to sleep beside
me. If I am up first it spends a
full half-hour in caressing me, playing
with my fingers like a little dog, jumping
on my head and my neck with a
lightness and elegance which I have
never found in other animals. If I
present my hands at the distance of
three feet it jumps into them without
ever missing. It exhibits great address
and cunning to compass its ends, and
seems to disobey certain prohibitions
merely through caprice. In the midst
of twenty people it distinguishes my
voice, seeks me out and springs over
all the others to come at me."</p>

<p>The weasel probably lives from eight
to twelve years. It is easily caught in
a trap, with bait of an egg, a small bird,
or a mouse. No other animal is so
fitly endowed for hunting mice.</p>

<p>In the attempt to check the rabbit
pest in New Zealand, recourse has been
had to the importation of natural enemies,
such as ferrets, stoats, and weasels.
In the Wairarapa district some
600 ferrets, 300 stoats and weasels, and
300 cats had been turned out previous
to 1887. Between January, 1887, and
June, 1888, contracts were made by the
government for nearly 22,000 ferrets,
and several thousand had previously
been liberated on crown and private
lands. Large numbers of stoats and
weasels have also been liberated during
the last fifteen years.</p>

<p>This host of predatory animals speedily
brought about a decrease in the
number of rabbits, but their work was
not confined to rabbits, and soon game
birds and other species were found to
be diminishing. The stoat and the weasel
are much more bloodthirsty than
the ferret, and the widespread destruction
is attributed to them rather than
to the latter animal. Now that some
of the native birds are threatened with
extermination, it has been suggested
to set aside an island along the New
Zealand coast, where the more interesting
indigenous species can be kept
safe from their enemies and saved from
complete extinction.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRDS_AND_THE_WEATHER" id="BIRDS_AND_THE_WEATHER"></a>
  BIRDS AND THE WEATHER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BIRDS are dependent on the elements
as well as is man, and in
the want of materials and the
requirements in nest-building
the birds are comparable to the lords
of creation.</p>

<p>It is not a rare thing for a pair of
robins to be badly handicapped in
nesting-time by a lack of rain, for in
May, and even in the showery month
of April, there is occasionally a dry
run of weather lasting for more than a
week.</p>

<p>I have seen a pair of robins start a
nest, and the dry weather would come
on and stop operations, and the disconsolate
pair would wait for the rain
so that they could make mortar for
their nest. Robins must have mud to
use in the construction of their little
home, and all the dry materials will
avail them nothing unless there is a
good stock of mortar on hand to
cement the grass, rags, and other materials
together.</p>

<p>On one occasion we supplied a pair
of redbreasts with plenty of mortar
by letting the hydrant run on the
ground. The delighted robins immediately
accepted the situation and
gathered materials for the partially
finished home, which was quickly completed
and the four beautiful eggs deposited.
We broke the law by letting
the water run, but then we can excuse
ourselves in behalf of the faithful
birds by saying that "necessity knows
no law."</p>

<p>The eave-swallows also require mortar
for the construction of their nests,
and they select quarters not very far
removed from lakes, ponds, or streams.
There is a neighborhood where the
swallows used to build in great numbers,
and the barns were well patronized
by these little insect-feeders, rows
of the gourd-shaped nests being seen
beneath the eaves.</p>

<p>At last the pond in the section was
drained, and all the swallows deserted
that neighborhood. There are very
few birds which are not more or less
affected by civilization, and a study of
this subject is most interesting.</p>

<p>Years ago the chimney swifts were
in the habit of building their stick
nests in the hollows of big trees, and
even at the present day we may find
nests in these old-time situations. As
time passed the swifts found that the
chimneys of men's houses offered
better situations for nests, and so the
reasoning birds adopted our city and
village chimneys to the abandonment
of the primitive habit of nesting in
hollow trees.&mdash;<i>Humane Alliance.</i></p>

<h2><a name="STRANGE_ILLUMINATIONS" id="STRANGE_ILLUMINATIONS"></a>
  STRANGE ILLUMINATIONS.</h2>

<p class="ac">BIRDS THAT CARRY LIGHTS.</p>

<p class="ac">P. W. H.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_l_alt.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">"LIGHTNING BUGS" and other
insects that carry lights are
familiar in many parts of the
country, but who ever heard of
birds that carry lights? A strange
story is told of the heron's powder
patch which makes a two-candle light,
which discloses a new idea in bird lore.
A belated sportsman returning from a
day's sport found himself late in the
evening on the edge of a flat or marsh
which bordered the path. The moon
had not risen, and the darkness was so
intense that he was obliged to move
slowly and carefully. As he walked
along, gun on shoulder, he thought he
saw a number of lights, some moving,
others stationary. As they were in the
river bed, he knew that they could not
be lanterns, and for some time he was
puzzled; but, being of an inquisitive
mind, he walked down to the water to
investigate.</p>

<p>As the stream was a slow-running,
shallow one, he had no difficulty in
wading in, and soon convinced himself
that the lights were not carried by men,
and were either ignes fatui or from
some cause unknown. To settle the
apparent mystery he crept as close as
he could, took careful aim and fired.
At the discharge the lights disappeared,
but, keeping his eye on the spot where
they had been, he walked quickly to it
and found, to his amazement, a night
heron, upon whose breast gleamed the
mysterious light.</p>

<p>"The sportsman told me of this incident,"
says a friend who knew him well,
"and, while I had often heard of the
light on the heron's breast, I never before
could find anyone who had personally
witnessed the phenomenon, consequently
I propounded numerous questions.
The observer saw the light distinctly;
first at a distance of at least
fifty yards, or one hundred and fifty
feet. There were three lights upon
each bird&mdash;one upon each side between
the hips and tail, and one upon the
breast.</p>

<p>"He saw the lights of at least four individuals,
and was so interested that he
observed them all carefully and, as to
their intensity, stated to me that each
light was the equivalent of two candles,
so that when he aimed he could see
the gun-sight against it.</p>

<p>"As to whether the bird had control
of the light, he believed he did, as he saw
the lights open and shut several times
as he crawled toward the birds and he
stopped when the light disappeared and
crept on when it came again. The light
did not endure long after the bird was
shot, fading away almost immediately.
In color the light was white and reminded
the sportsman of phosphorescent
wood.</p>

<p>"Stories of luminous birds have been
related by sportsmen occasionally, but,
so far as I know, exact facts and data
have never before been obtained on this
most interesting and somewhat sensational
subject. A friend in Florida
told we that he had distinctly seen a
light moving about in a flock of cranes
at night and became satisfied that the
light was the breast of the bird. Another
friend informed me that on entering
a heron rookery at night he had
distinctly observed lights moving about
among the birds."</p>

<p>That herons have a peculiar possible
light-producing apparatus is well
known. These are called powder-down
patches, and can be found by turning
up the long feathers on the heron's
breast, where will be found a patch of
yellow, greasy material that sometimes
drops off or fills the feathers in the
form of a yellow powder. This powder
is produced by the evident decomposition
of the small feathers, producing
just such a substance as one
might expect would become phosphorescent,
as there is little doubt that it
does.</p>

<p>The cranes and herons are not the
only birds having these oily lamps, if so
we may term them. A Madagascar
bird, called kirumbo, has a large patch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on each side of the rump. The bitterns
have two pairs of patches; the true herons
three, while the curious boat-bills
have eight, which, if at times all luminous,
would give the bird a most conspicuous,
not to say spectral appearance
at night.</p>

<p>Some years ago a party of explorers
entered a large cave on the island of
Trinidad that had hitherto been considered
inaccessible. To their astonishment
they found it filled with birds
which darted about in the dark in such
numbers that they struck the explorers
and rendered their passage not only
disagreeable, but dangerous. The birds
proved to be night hawks, known as
oil birds, and in great demand for the
oil they contain, and it is barely possible
that these birds are also light-givers.
The powder-down patches of the
oil bird are upon each side of the rump.</p>

<p>As to the use of such lights to a bird
there has been much conjecture; but it
is thought that it may be a lure to attract
fishes. It is well known that
fishes and various marine animals are
attracted by light, and a heron standing
motionless in the water, the light
from its breast, if equal to two candles,
would be plainly seen for a considerable
distance by various kinds of fishes, which
would undoubtedly approach within
reach of the eagle eye and sharp bill of
the heron and so fall victims to their
curiosity. If this is a true solving of
the mystery it is one of the most remarkable
provisions of nature.</p>

<p>There is hardly a group of animals
that does not include some light-givers
of great beauty; but it is not generally
known that some of the higher animals
also produce light at times. Renninger,
the naturalist, whose studies and observations
of Paraguay are well known,
tells a most remarkable story of his experience
with the monkey known as
<i>Nyctipithithecus trivigatus</i>. He was in
complete darkness when he observed
the phenomenon, which was a phosphorescent
light gleaming from the
eyes of the animal; not the light which
appears in the eye of the cat, but shafts
of phosphorescent light which were not
only distinctly visible, but illumined
objects a distance of six inches from
the animal's eyes.</p>

<p>The subject is an interesting one and
research among the various phenomena
disclosed by naturalists may discover
many other animals capable of strange
illuminations.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_n.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NOT the least interesting of my
summer neighbors is a Quaker
family named Chebec, the least
fly-catchers.</p>

<p>They are little people, else they
would not be least fly-catchers, plainly
dressed, with olive shoulder-capes lined
with yellow, wings finely barred with
black and white and heads dark and
mousy. The large eyes, circled with
white, are as full of expression as a
thrush's.</p>

<p>What is lacking in song is made up in
an energy decidedly muscular, the
originality of the note <i>chebec</i>, uttered
with a jerk of the head or a launch into
the air after some passing insect, never
being confused with other bird voices.</p>

<p>It is not Chebec himself that commands
my special admiration, but
"Petite," his winsome little lady, with
her rare gentleness and confidence.
Our intimacy began when she was living
on a long maple branch that nearly
touched my chamber window, and she
was dancing attendance upon four pure-white
eggs when I became conscious
of her neighborly intentions. She soon
settled down into the most demure little
matron, a regular stay-at-home,
really grudging the time necessary
for taking her meals. Later, when I
"peeked in" at the nestlings, Petite
only hugged them closer, nor did she
leave until my hand was laid on her
shoulder. We were soon fast friends.
The most tempting morsels the neighborhood
afforded were brought to her
door, and, though she was unwearied
in the family service, my efforts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
gratefully received, even anticipated.
The following spring her choice of
residence was a bough that hung over
the door, coming to the end of the
branch whenever I appeared in an
effort to express her approval. For,
you see, I had given her a quantity of
strings and lace and cotton for her
nest, and she was truly grateful!</p>

<p>Excess of splendor is always perilous.
The work of art was no sooner
completed than Robin Redbreast grew
envious, rushed over and pulled out the
finest strings, leaving the nest in so
shaky a condition that the wind soon
finished it.</p>

<p>Petite's feelings were deeply injured&mdash;she
could not be induced to rebuild
near her malicious neighbor.</p>

<p>To help her forget her troubles I
gave her some yellow ravelings, much
handsomer than those Robin had
stolen.</p>

<p>Thoroughly consoled, she worked as
fast as she possibly could until the last
ray of light had faded. Knowing that
Robin's impudence had delayed her
spring's work, I did my best to supply
her needs.</p>

<p>Altogether her patience was extreme.
Occasionally she hinted gently that
her time was precious or that I was
keeping her waiting, as she hovered
about my face or rested briefly upon my
shoe, keeping a sharp lookout meanwhile
upon the cloth I was raveling.</p>

<p>How she scampered off when it was
ready, snatching it from my hand before
it reached the ground!</p>

<p>The next day saw the new house
completed&mdash;no ordinary affair, but a
magnificent dwelling, yellow from foundation
to rafter, with a long, fantastic
fringe of the same floating from its rim
and waving gracefully in every breeze.</p>

<p>Petite now became my attentive companion
in my garden work, talking in
subdued tones from the nearest branch
as if she felt the seriousness of the
occasion, circling in the air and alighting
on the same bough in pretended
alarm when I tried to touch her soft,
delicate feathers.</p>

<p>May 3d of this present year she
called softly from the orchard that she
had arrived. For a few days she had
little to say, wearied with the long
journey and being broken of her rest,
as must have been the case. She was
not quite herself, either&mdash;really put on
airs and kept at a distance; but when
she began to think of housekeeping she
was the same trusting darling that won
my heart and gave me willing hands
in her service.</p>

<p>We talked matters over on the piazza
while she fluttered about my head,
touched my hat with dainty feet, or
poised before me to say in her own
pretty way that it was quite time to be
thinking of sitting. "What do you
propose to do for me <i>this</i> year? How
much help can I rely upon from you?"
she asked as plainly as if she spoke
English.</p>

<p>"Ah, Petite," I answered, "you must
not demand <i>too</i> much. It is quite time
the sweet peas were planted!" But
words were useless; she coaxed, enticed,
pleaded, until mine was a full
and unconditioned surrender. "You
deserve it, Petite, for your perseverance!
You shall have the finest house
that was ever seen in this section," I
said, and with that promise we parted.</p>

<p>I found a quantity of jeweler's cotton,
pink as a rosebud, soft and fluffy
and light enough to satisfy the most
fastidious bird architect. Small pieces
were placed upon lawn and tree
trunks, where Petite soon spied them;
her first impulse was one of approval.</p>

<p>Not meaning to be rash in her judgment,
her head was cocked cunningly
on one side as she poised, eyeing them
closely, until I feared that, dissatisfied,
she would accuse me of breaking my
promise.</p>

<p>When she seized one, cautiously, in
her beak and sailed away with it trailing
after her in the air my fears were
over. As no harm attended its transfer
to the orchard, where it was adjusted
to her taste, her admiring mate
left his fly-catching to help in the
work, the cotton disappearing so rapidly
there were signs of a corner in the
market.</p>

<p>The nest, strengthened with a few
strings, grew rapidly toward completion.
To all appearance its unique
beauty was a matter of congratulation,
the builders regarding it from all sides
with intense satisfaction.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE quince is the pear-like fruit
of a bush or small tree resembling
the pear tree. The
branches are spreading and of a
grayish green or brownish green color.
The leaves are simple, entire, ovate,
with short petioles and distinct stipules.
The lower surface of leaves and stipules
as well as the young twigs and the
sepals are densely covered with hair-cells
producing a woolly appearance.
The flowers develop in May and June
and are usually solitary upon terminal
branches. Calyx green with five foliaceous,
serrate, reflexed lobes. Corolla
of five separate ovate, rather large, pink
petals. Stamens yellow, numerous (20);
five styles and a five-celled ovary. The
matured fruit is a pome. That is, the
greater bulk consists of the thickened
calyx enclosing the ovary. The form, size
and color of the ripe fruit are shown in
the illustration. Each cell of the ovary
bears from six to fifteen seeds which
resemble apple seeds very closely as to
form and color.</p>

<p>The name <i>Cydonia</i> is derived from
the name of the Greek city Cydon, now
Canea, of Crete. The Cydonian apple
of the Greeks was emblematic of fortune,
love and fertility, and was dedicated
to the goddess Aphrodite (Venus).
It is a question whether Crete was the
original home of the quince. Some authorities
maintain that it found its way
into Greece from upper Asia, Persia,
or India. Wherever its first home may
have been this plant was known in
Greece 700 years B. C. From Greece
the tree was introduced into Italy and
Spain, from which countries it finally
spread over central Europe. Charlemagne,
Karl der Grosse&mdash;812, was
largely instrumental in spreading the
quince in Germany.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks made extensive
medicinal use of the fruit. On account
of its astringency it has been used in
dysentery, hemorrhage, and other conditions
requiring an astringent substance.
At present it is little used, the
seeds excepted.</p>

<p>The pulp is fibrous and tough; it is
not edible in the raw state on account
of its acrid, astringent taste. As a
whole it is a discouraging and disagreeable
fruit in spite of its beautiful yellow
color and pleasantly aromatic odor.
Mixed with apples it makes excellent
pies and tarts. A marmalade is made
from the pulp, also a delicious jelly. It
is stated that the word marmalade is
derived from <i>marmelo</i>, the Portuguese
name for quince.</p>

<p>The seeds are extensively used on account
of the mucilage of the outer surface
(epidermal cells). A decoction
commonly known as mucilage of quince
seed is much used as a demulcent in
certain diseases&mdash;in erysipelas, inflammatory
conditions of the eyes and in
other affections where mucilaginous
applications are found useful. The
Mohammedans of India value the
seeds very highly as a restorative and
demulcent tonic. European physicians
have used them with much success in
dysentery. The mucilage is also one
of the substances used by hair-dressers
under the name of <i>bandoline</i>.</p>

<p>Chemically the mucilage is simply a
modification of cellulose. Pereira considered
it a special chemical substance
which he designated <i>cydonin</i>. The seed,
about 20 per cent. of which is mucilage,
will make a sticky emulsion with
forty times its weight of water. As to
its physical properties it closely resembles
gum arabic and agar. There are,
however, simple tests by means of which
it is possible to distinguish them. The
seeds rubbed or crushed emit an odor
resembling almonds, due to the presence
of hydrocyanic acid.</p>

<p>Most of the quince seed of the market
comes from southern Russia, southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
France and the Cape of Good Hope.
It is cultivated in various temperate
and subtropical countries.</p>

<p>The quince must not be confounded
with the Indian "bael" fruit which is
known in India as the Bengal quince.
The Chinese quince is a species of pear.
The Japanese quince is also a species of
pear resembling the Chinese quince. It
is a great garden favorite on account of
its large scarlet or crimson flowers. The
fruit, which is not edible in the raw
state, resembles a small apple and is
sometimes used for making a jelly.
The Portugal quince differs from the
ordinary variety by its more delicate
coloring. It is, however, less productive
than the common varieties.</p>

<p class="ac">DIAMONDS AND GOLD.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_c.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">CECIL RHODES says: "So long
as women are vain and men
foolish there will be no diminution
in the demand for diamonds."
He ought to know, for he is
called the "Diamond King."</p>

<p>Thirty years ago John O'Reilly found
some children at a farm house in South
Africa playing in the evening with
some beautiful stones that had peculiar
forms and brilliancy. He took the
finest to town with him and found it
was worth $500.</p>

<p>People swarmed into the country
where little children had rough diamonds
for playthings, and over $400,000,000
worth of these crystals has been
taken from Africa.</p>

<p>While the diamond excitement was
still raging the people were inflamed at
finding there was gold about them in
great quantities. The diamond hunters
in many instances became gold
diggers, because there was even more
money to be made in gold digging than
in hunting for diamonds.</p>

<p>Last year nearly $75,000,000 worth
of gold was produced in that country.
That is more than we produced in the
great gold fields of the United States
all taken together. We crushed from
the rocks and dug out of the dirt about
$65,000,000 in gold. The famous gold
fields of Australia yielded about the
same amount as our own country.</p>

<p>So much wealth in Africa has embittered
the people. The Dutch farmers,
called boers, occupy the heart of
the best country. They are not progressive,
the English say. Perhaps
they mean that the boers do not move
away fast enough to suit the English.
They have made trek after trek to get
out of the way of the English. Trek
means journey. But when they realized
how much wealth there was about
them in the country which they had
thought was so poor, they decided not
to make any more treks to let the
British in.</p>

<p>These Dutch farmers withstood the
English at Majuba Hill, Jan. 28, 1881,
and killed off nearly all the British
forces sent against them. In this fight
they lost but fourteen men in killed
and wounded, while wiping out their
enemies. They celebrate this day as
we do the Fourth of July. It is their
day of independence, and they do not
wish to give up the advantage it gave
them. Sixty years ago less than five
hundred boers under Andries Pretorius
defeated twelve thousand Zulus, killing
three thousand of them.</p>

<p>As the Dutch have such a good reason
for trusting to their weapons there
is little wonder that the gold and the
diamonds of the country brought them
into a war with England.</p>

<h2><a name="LIQUID_AIR" id="LIQUID_AIR"></a>LIQUID AIR.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_m.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">MANY substances have three
forms&mdash;solid, liquid, and gaseous.
It takes cold to change a
gas to a liquid, and more cold
to reduce the liquid to a solid. Steam,
water, and ice are good examples.</p>

<p>Air is a substance that requires so
much cold to reduce it even to a liquid
state that we know nothing of it as a
solid. Our Smithsonian Institution
gave Professor Dewar of the Royal Institute
of London a gold medal for his
discovery in regard to reducing it to a
liquid.</p>

<p>No artificial cold is intense enough
to affect air except when it is confined
under great pressure. When a gas is
compressed and made cold it tends to
liquefy. But it takes enormous pressure
and intense cold to make liquid air.</p>

<p>It is a grayish substance that may be
carried about like water. It has a tendency
to steam up, and when its vapor
comes into contact with flesh a cooling
sensation is produced. But living flesh
cannot long remain in contact with
the liquid itself. It produces a wound
much like a burn.</p>

<p>By careful use of liquid air in surgery,
the flesh may be so put to sleep
that the surgeon's knife is not felt by
the patient as he watches the cutting.
A cancer has been cut out by liquid
air in a sort of burning process that
needed no knife. Cremation has been
accomplished by its use.</p>

<p>Cremation is burning. Burning is
the union of oxygen with the substance
consumed. Liquid air left exposed to
common air evaporates and sends out
its nitrogen so that almost pure liquid
oxygen is left in the vessel. This
placed in contact with the body to be
consumed soon sends all except its
mineral parts flying away in the
atmosphere in a vapor thinner than
smoke.</p>

<p>It is the coldest substance known.
It takes an intense cold to produce it,
and it has to remain cold much as ice
is cold, only very much more so, as
long as it is liquid air. For this reason
it is carried about in vessels constructed
so as to exclude the heat.
Mercury dropped into it becomes a
solid block, and meat quickly freezes
so hard that it is brittle as glass and
may be broken into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>The liquid oxygen left after exposure
of liquid air may be placed in a
hollow in a cake of ice. Dip into it a
watch spring and touch a lighted
match to it and you will see the steel
spring burn as if it were full of pitch.</p>

<p>Eight hundred gallons of common
air are compressed into one gallon of
the liquid. The liquid is unattractive
and very common-looking. You would
not suspect its great powers by merely
looking at it in a dish. But when it
expands into common air it has tremendous
energy. A few drops confined
in a closed iron pipe will explode
and blow the metal to atoms.</p>

<p>When first produced it was so expensive
a product that its value was
above that of rubies. Now it is cheap
and becoming more so. We expect it
to become an ordinary article of commerce.
One company is capitalized at
$10,000,000 to push its use in place of
steam and electricity.</p>

<p>Probably some of the companies advertising
shares to sell are putting its
powers far too high. One company's
agents are representing that a very
little of it in a cup will keep an icebox
cold all day, and that a pound of it
will reduce the heat in a large house
on a warm summer day so that it may
be kept cool at very small expense.</p>

<p>These extravagant claims are probably
made for the purpose of deceiving
people so they will buy shares. The
facts seem to show that a pint of liquid
air will not cool an ice box much more
than will a pound of ice. The effect
of a gallon of it in a large house would
scarcely be felt in July, except for a
short time in one or two rooms.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">COMPARATIVELY few persons
associate the gem opal, with its
brilliant internal colored reflections,
with that material forming
so large a part of the soil, sand.
Yet the two are almost identical in
composition. The mineral constituent
of sand and of opal is quartz, though
the latter often contains in addition
some water.</p>

<p>Quartz is composed of the two
elements occurring the most abundantly
in the earth's crust, silicon and
oxygen, both non-metals. As already
indicated, the most common representative
of the mineral substance is the
sand of the soil. The sand grains are
generally so eroded by the atmosphere
and surface waters as to show little of
the true quartz structure. A typical
specimen of quartz, commonly known
as "rock crystal," clear, transparent
and approximately perfect in form, is
not difficult to obtain for study. If
not occurring in the particular locality
it may be obtained from a dealer in
minerals at slight expense. As studied
by means of the rock crystal, quartz is
remarkable for its transparency, its
regular crystal form, and its great degree
of hardness. Its transparency is
such that printing may be read through
the crystal. Its crystalline form
affords an unfailing means to the
mineralogist of recognizing the substance
as quartz. If our specimen be
large and perfect, we note that it is
bounded by planes in such manner
that we have a hexagonal prism terminated
at either end by a hexagonal
pyramid. With convenient apparatus
for measurement, we learn the all-important
fact to the mineralogist, that
the angle between any prism face and
an adjacent pyramid face is 141° 47´.
The mineralogist obtains his accurate
measurements by means of an instrument
known as the goniometer. We
may obtain cruder results by bending
a readily flexible wire over the two
faces, perpendicular to the edge of
their intersection, until it is tight
against either face. Then placing one
arm of the bent wire along the base of
a protractor, the point of flexure at the
center of the base, the number of degrees
between the two arms may be
read, thus giving roughly the angle between
the prism and pyramid faces of
the quartz crystal. The great hardness
of quartz is apparent in that it cannot
be scratched with the point of a
knife and that it will cut glass. Often
clear parts of quartz crystals occur
studding the surface of a rock structure,
in the form known as a crystal aggregate.
One property of quartz rock
(any sandstone or quartzite) we must
not fail to notice is the irregular fracture.
This is recognized in the statement
that quartz has no cleavage.</p>

<p>The study of the rock crystal should
not lead us into the false conclusion
that quartz is commonly transparent.
Instead it occurs in various shades and
colors from smoky white through yellow,
red, purple, and brown to black.
The cause of the abundance of sand on
the soil surface is also liable to misinterpretation.
While sand is naturally
of great abundance, yet its commonness
at the surface of the soil is due
largely to its great resistant powers to
the agencies of weathering.</p>

<p>Quartz has an economic value directly
in glass sand and of course as a
soil constituent. In the latter capacity,
it is taken up by many plants, and is
the silica that studs the saw edges of
the blades of sedges and grasses. The
precious stones, agate, amethyst, and
jasper are varieties of quartz.</p>

<p>The silicon that is so important a
constituent of quartz, composes with
aluminum a large part of various
minerals comprised under the name
feldspar. This substance is slightly
less hard than quartz and has many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
variations in color; but, unlike quartz,
shows regular cleavage faces. Feldspar
is always crystalline, but good
crystals are not common. It is very
difficultly soluble, yet readily yields to
the influence of weathering. A feldspathic
rock hence readily crumbles.
During the process of disintegration,
the feldspar may change from a clear,
hard, glassy mineral to a dull, opaque
substance. This product of disintegration
is our common white clay. With
quartz, then, feldspar is of great importance
in the forming of soil.</p>

<p>Allied to the feldspar group of
minerals as regards cleavage, and yet
of far different special characteristics
is the class of substances known as
mica. How many of us ever think of
the so-called isinglass of our stove
doors as a mineral substance? Yet
transparent mica, muscovite, is the
source of that household convenience.
A study of the specimens of mica in
our stove door will provide abundant
ideas of the nature of mica. We have
often noticed how, under the influence
of excessive heat, the isinglass splits
into thin sheets, thus showing the
cleavage of the mineral. These plates
of mica are of especial value in giving
cleavage to rocks which would otherwise
fracture irregularly. The cleavage
of slates and of the common shale
rocks is due to the presence of mica
particles which have, at some period in
the history of the earth's crust, through
the action of heat and pressure, been
arranged along definite planes. Isinglass
represents the transparent variety
of mica. Other varieties are brown
and even black, owing to the presence
of traces of potassium, magnesium,
iron, etc., in varying degree. Some
micas do not easily decay, and so we
frequently see glittering particles
among the fine grains of soil and the
sands of beaches.</p>

<p>The minerals already mentioned,
quartz, feldspar, and mica, are the components
of a large part of our granites.
In the case of the red Scotch granite,
another silicate, hornblende, replaces

  THE DANGER FROM THE IMPORTATION OF ANIMALS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">AN abstract of J. S. Palmer's essay
on "The Danger of Introducing
Noxious Animals and Birds"
appears in <i>Our Animal Friends</i>.
There are several societies in this country
for the express purpose of purchasing
and importing European birds.
One society in Cincinnati has contributed
$9,000 to this object, and other
cities have raised considerable sums.
Our contemporary thinks it would be
well that all such experiments should
be made under the sanction of government
experts of the Department or
Agriculture. In addition to voluntary
importations, it often happens that
animals are unintentionally brought
into the country, as trading-vessels
have carried the European house
mouse all over the globe, and the introduction
of rabbits into Australia is
perhaps the most striking example of
the dangers of unconsidered importations.
They were introduced for purposes
of sport, and were liberated near
Melbourne in 1864. Within twelve
years they had spread over the country
and become a veritable plague, and
millions of dollars have been spent for
bounties, poisons, and other methods
of destruction. Thousands of miles of
rabbit-proof fences have been built,
and in 1887 no less than 19,182,539 rabbits
were destroyed in New South
Wales alone, and the rabbits seem to
be on the increase. The little Indian
mongoose was imported into Jamaica
to cope with a plague of rats and
proved most effective, but after it had
destroyed the rats it turned its attention
to the domestic animals and poultry,
so that the islanders would now be
glad if they could get rid of the pests.
Such are a few examples of the danger
of disturbing nature's balance.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AMERICAN_BISON" id="THE_AMERICAN_BISON"></a>
  THE AMERICAN BISON.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A REMARKABLE article recently
appeared in the <i>Scientific
American</i>, written by Prof. Chas.
F. Holder, entitled, "A Crime
of a Century," in which is described the
extermination, the wiping out of the
American bison.</p>

<p>"In 1870, and later," said an army
officer, "the plains were alive with
bison, and in crossing at places I had
difficulty in avoiding them, so vast
were the herds. If anyone had told
me then that in twenty or thirty years
they would have become almost entirely
extinct I should have regarded
the statement as that of an insane
person."</p>

<p>We are able to corroborate this statement.
In August, 1869, while crossing
the Kansas plains in a stagecoach we
had the privilege, as we regard it now,
of seeing one of the largest herds of
buffalo then remaining. When first
seen, at a distance of from three to five
miles, we could distinctly hear the
roaring of the animals, who had been
stampeded, perhaps by hunters, who
were at that time wantonly destroying
the grand creatures for their robes.
That so many of these animals could
have been killed in mere wantonness,
says Prof. Holder, seems incredible
when their vast numbers are realized.
We first hear of the bison from Cortez
and his followers in 1521. Montezuma
had one in a zoölogical garden, the
specimen, in all probability, having
been caught in Coahuila. In 1530 Cabeza
saw them in Texas, and in 1542
Coronado found a herd in what is now
the Indian Territory, one of his officers
describing them as horrible beasts that
demoralized the horses. In 1612 Sir
Samuel Argall observed herds of bison
near the national capital, and, it is
said, two hundred and eighty-seven
years ago herds of bison grazed on the
site of the capitol building at Washington.
In 1678 Father Hennepin observed
them in what is now northern
Illinois, and in October, 1729, Col. W.
Bird saw herds in North Carolina and
Virginia. It is known, in fact, that the
bison formerly ranged in millions from
the Atlantic seaboard to the Gulf of
Mexico, from Texas to the Great Slave
Lake, and as far west as central Nevada.
"As to their numbers, they were
like the sands of the seashore, and the
accounts given by those who hunted
them twenty or thirty years ago to-day
seem like vagaries of a disordered imagination."
Colonel Dodge, in his memoirs,
states that on one occasion he
rode twenty-five miles in Arkansas,
always being in a herd of buffaloes, or
many small herds, with but a small
separating strip between them. The
animals paid but little attention to him,
merely moving slowly out of the way
or advancing, bringing the whole herd
of thousands down on him with the
roar of an avalanche. This he met by
standing fast and firing when they
came within short range, the shot causing
them to divide. This he did as a
protection, otherwise they would have
run him down and crushed man, horses,
and wagon. This herd was later found
to be fifty miles wide and to occupy
five days in passing a given point on
its way north. It was estimated that
the herd comprised half a million buffaloes.
A train on the Kansas Pacific
road in that state in 1868 passed between
the towns of Ellsworth and Sheridan&mdash;one
hundred and twenty miles&mdash;through
a continuous herd of buffaloes.
They were packed so that the
earth was black, and more than once
the train was stopped, the surging mass
becoming a menace to human safety.
This is the same herd first seen by us
in August, 1869, and again in 1871 and
1872. An army officer relates that he
was at that time on duty in the pay
department, which made it necessary
for him to travel on the Atchison, Topeka
&amp; Santa Fe railroad. One day
the train entered a large herd, which
scattered and seemed to go wild at the
shrieking of the whistle and the ringing
of the bell. As the train went on
the thicker they became, until the very
earth appeared to be a rolling mass of
humps as far as the eye could see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Suddenly some of the animals nearest
turned and charged; others fell in behind,
and down upon the train they
came like an avalanche. The engineer
stopped the engine, let off steam and
whistled to stop them, while the passengers
fired from the platforms and
windows with rifles and revolvers, but
it was like trying to stay a tidal wave.
On they came, the earth trembling, and
plunged head down into the train.
Some were wedged in between the
cars, others beneath; and so great was
the crush that they toppled three cars
over and actually scrambled over them,
one buffalo becoming bogged by having
his legs caught in the window.</p>

<p>The question of interest to-day is
how was it possible to destroy so many
animals in so short a time and what
methods were employed? Many were
destroyed by stampeding over precipices.
In 1867 two thousand buffaloes
became entangled in the quicksands of
the Platte river. At another time a
herd was lost by breaking through the
ice of Lac Qui Parle in Minnesota.
The cold winters of the north killed
many. But man was their greatest foe.
He soon found that the buffaloes had
a value. The Indians slaughtered them
for their skins, bone and for food. The
white man, however, killed for sport,
for the hides and heads, and to provide
the gangs of railroad men with
meat. The animal at this time had a
value estimated at $5, which was sufficient
to attract an army of destroyers.
One firm in New York between 1876
and 1884 paid for hides alone nearly
$1,000,000. The government never interfered.
The real extermination of
the buffalo, in the opinion of Prof.
Holder, was caused by the demands of
trade, aided and abetted by sportsmen,
Indians, and others; but the blame
really lies with the government that in
all these years permitted a few ignorant
congressmen to block legislation
in favor of the protection of the bison,
so that all the efforts of humanitarians
were defeated and the bills when passed
pigeon holed.</p>

<p>The still hunter was the most insidious
enemy of the buffalo, a single man,
by sneaking upon a herd, having been
known to kill one thousand in a single
season. Capt. Jack Bridges, of Kansas,
killed 1,142 buffaloes in six weeks.
In the different states there were regular
killing outfits that cost, in rifles,
horses, carts, etc., from $2,000 to $5,000.
Such methods developed some famous
characters. Buffalo Bill (Col. W. F.
Cody) was one. He contracted with
the Kansas Pacific railroad to furnish
them with all the buffalo the men could
eat as the road was built; and, according
to Mr. Cody's statement, they ate
4,280 buffaloes in eighteen months, for
which he received $500 per month, "the
price he paid for his title."</p>

<p>There were living at the last government
census, made in 1891, 256 pure-blooded
buffaloes in captivity, the last
of the race.</p>

<p>A buffalo robe is now a scarce article
and a well-preserved specimen
brings a high price. Massive heads of
old bull buffaloes are preserved in many
museums and are valued at from $150
to $250.</p>

<p>Mark Twain once said that the most
wonderful scene he had ever looked
upon was an enormous herd of buffaloes
in Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. John D. Dunham, formerly
United States land commissioner in
Wyoming, and later connected with
the Yellowstone Park commission, recently
stated that there were between
120 and 140 buffaloes left in the United
States last autumn, and the mortality
among the surviving beasts was greater
last winter than ever before during
their captivity. Despite the severe
penalty for killing the big animals in
the National Park, a dozen or more
buffaloes have been slain there every
year. Last year a form of influenza
destroyed some of them, and there are
probably no more than fifty of the veterans
of the plains left. Baker, in his
"Wild Beasts and Their Ways," says:
"The bison is a grand-looking creature,
and in my opinion it is the most
striking of all wild animals."</p>

  THE SORROWFUL TREE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a tree in Paris to which
the name "The Sorrowful Tree"
is given. Perhaps because it
blooms only in the evening.</p>

<p>When the first star appears in the
heavens, the first bud of the Sorrowful
Tree opens, and as the shades of night
advance and the stars thickly stud the
sky, the buds continue gradually opening
until the whole tree looks like one
immense white flower. On the approach
of dawn, when the brilliancy of
the stars gradually fades away in the
light of day, the Sorrowful Tree closes
its flowers, and ere the sun is fully
risen not a single blossom is visible.
A sheet of flower dust, as white as
snow, covers the ground around the
foot of the tree, which seems blighted
and withered during the day, while,
however, it is actively preparing for
the next nocturnal festival. The fragrance
of the blossom is like that of
the evening primrose.</p>

<p>If the tree is cut down close to the
roots a new plant shoots up and attains
maturity in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of this singular tree
there usually grows another, which is
almost an exact counterpart of the
Sorrowful Tree, but less beautiful, and,
strange to say, it blooms only in the
daytime.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN one of the cages at Lincoln Park
are two pigeons or doves most peculiarly
marked. They belong to
the variety known as the "Bleeding
Heart."</p>

<p>Their backs and wings are of a bluish
slate color, while their breasts are white,
save for a spot of vivid crimson in the
center. This spot is precisely like
the stain which would be produced by a
wound. It is about an inch in length,
and the color fades out at the edges
softly in little streaks.</p>

<p>One can scarcely believe the little
creatures are not victims of some cruel
thrust, and the park employes say that
lovesick people are wont to lean for
hours on the railing opposite the cage,
and, fixing their sad eyes on the birds,
will moan in sympathy while they shed
bitter tears.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE lily of the valley is one of
the most delicate and beautiful
of the lily family (<i>Liliaceæ</i>).
With the exception of the orchid
family probably no group of
plants furnishes a larger variety of
popular forms noted alike for their
beauty and delicacy.</p>

<p>It has been truly said of the lily
family that "the flowers of most
are beautiful, of many brilliant, and
of some truly splendid." This family
contains about one hundred and fifty
genera and over thirteen hundred
species. They are world-wide in their
distribution, excepting the Arctic zone,
though they are more common in the
temperate and subtropical regions.</p>

<p>Among the species sought by the
lover of cultivated flowers none is more
noteworthy than the tulip, a native of
Persia. It is claimed that there are
more than seven hundred forms of the
tulip known to the florist&mdash;all variations
of a single species.</p>

<p>The type of the family is the lily.
The lily is the Persian personification
of night, <i>lil</i> or <i>lilleh</i> being
essentially the words used to designate
evening. It is the Indo-Iranian analogue
of the rose, which in countries
speaking the romance languages, as
well as in China, stands for a symbol of
secrecy and was planted over graves as
an emblem of immortality.</p>

<p>To this family also belong the day-lily,
the tuberose, the hyacinth, the
yucca, and the star-of-Bethlehem.
Here also is classed the useful though
much-abused onion, the flowers of
which, though small, form a most
graceful group at the top of the stem,
especially in the wild species.</p>

<p>Asparagus is usually placed in this
family and many species, such as
squills and the varieties of aloes, are
highly valued in medicine. In fact it
may be said that the family "abounds
in a bitter, stimulant principle and also
in mucilage." It is of interest that
some of the species of this family were
prized by the Greeks and Romans for
their medicinal value. The name for
aloes in both languages refers to the
bitter principle, and no name could be
more appropriate, as the extract is intensely
bitter.</p>

<p>The lily of the valley (<i>Convallaria
majalis, L.</i>) is a native of the mountainous
regions of Virginia and southward
through Georgia. It is identical
with the cultivated form which was
brought from Europe.</p>

<p>The generic name <i>Convallaria</i> from
two Latin words meaning "with" and
"valley," having reference to its habit of
growing on mountain sides. This
sweet-scented plant has an underground
stem which sends up a
stalk that bears, chiefly on one side,
numerous nodding white flowers. The
oblong leaves, usually two in number,
rise from the base of the flower-stalk,
which is sheathed by their stems.</p>

<p>The pure white of the flowers as
well as their symmetrical form has
led writers to speak of them as the
symbol of purity, and no flower, perhaps,
is in greater demand for the decoration
of the church and home.</p>

<h2><a name="MUSHROOMS_ON_BENCHES" id="MUSHROOMS_ON_BENCHES"></a>
  MUSHROOMS ON BENCHES.</h2>

<p class="ac">RICHARD MAXWELL.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">TO the amateur grower mushrooms
are ordinarily an uncertain
quantity. This crop is as
fickle and finicky as the proverbial
old maid&mdash;although, for my
part, I would far rather tackle the mushrooms.</p>

<p>The amateur mushroom grower, in
the usual order of things, generally has
"troubles of his own," troubles in which
even the old expert shares at times,
and often for a reason that is inexplicable,
or for a cause that is not even
apparent.</p>

<p>Some time ago I became interested
in a rather novel scheme in 'room production:
It is that of growing the
'rooms on top of the benches as one
would his regular crops of lettuce, raddishes,
etc., instead of under the
benches and in cellars in especially
prepared beds for that purpose. With
this new method the 'rooms are grown at
the same time as and among the usual
crops. In view of the experience I
feel justified in saying that a profitable
crop of 'rooms may be grown with more
certainty by this method than by the
one ordinarily practiced. I am not
aware of a single instance where a
grower of ordinary intelligence has
ever failed to secure a satisfactory crop
in this way.</p>

<p>The soil used is much the same as
the ordinary compost as generally put
up by the average hothouse operator.
In combination with the usual mixture
of rotted sod and horse manure the addition
of cow dung, at the ratio of
about one to ten, may be advantageously
made.</p>

<p>Should the cow dung be used it is
best to have that which is at least one
year old and in a fine, pulverized condition,
being careful to have the cow
dung well incorporated with the compost.</p>

<p>After the soil is placed in the
benches the bed may be immediately
spawned; no waiting for temperature
to go up or down. This work is done
just as in spawning an old-fashioned
bed, except that the spawn should be
buried somewhat deeper, to guard
against the surface drying of the soil
during a hard day's sun on the glass.</p>

<p>Since the operation of a hothouse is
a hard business proposition to the general
grower, involving the question of
the greatest production on the space
at hand, it is advisable to get a crop
growing on the benches as quickly as
possible after the bed is spawned.</p>

<p>If some crop that will rapidly
cover the surface of the bed is not
planted immediately after spawning
it is advisable to furnish some sort
of a mulch to protect the soil from the
direct rays of the sun. It is all the
better to provide such a mulch even
with the planted crop, filling in the unprotected
spaces. Partially decayed
leaves, fine salt hay, or any light, fluffy
material will serve the purpose. Providing
this mulch does not become
soggy or heavy there is no necessity
for removing it during the bearing
season of the mushroom.</p>

<p>Should the regular bench crop, lettuce,
for instance, be depended upon
to furnish shade, some more or less accurate
calculation should be made on
having such crop on the beds so that
it will protect the mushrooms when
they first make their appearance.</p>

<p>There is one other condition upon
which success is contingent, and that is
in the proper watering of the soil or
secondary crops. Water should be applied
lightly and frequently with a
spray nozzle, the object being to maintain
sufficient moisture in the soil to
supply the needs of the surface crop
without soaking or flooding the soil to
such a degree that it becomes unduly
heavy or soggy.</p>

<p>In cultivating the surface crop the
operator should not stir the soil to a
greater depth than two inches, that the
spawn may not be disturbed.</p>

<p>When the crops are cleared from the
benches in the spring it is well to allow
a dense mat of weeds to grow up to
protect the mushrooms from the sun,
which, otherwise, would "burn" or
brown them.&mdash;<i>American Gardening.</i></p>
